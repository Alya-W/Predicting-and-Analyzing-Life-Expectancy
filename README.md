# Predicting-and-Analyzing-Life-Expectancy

This project aims to analyze and forecast life expectancy using a comprehensive dataset sourced
primarily from the World Health Organization (WHO). However, it's worth noting that the
dataset utilized isn't directly sourced from WHO; rather, it's a "fixed" dataset that has undergone
cleaning procedures, including the correction of null values and inaccuracies. This cleaning
process was conducted by a Kaggle user using credible sources. The decision to utilize this
"fixed" dataset was made to streamline the preprocessing phase and ensure a more robust
foundation for subsequent analysis and forecasting endeavors related to life expectancy.
The dataset encompasses a wide array of variables spanning health indicators, immunization
rates, economic factors, and demographic information for 179 countries from 2000 to 2015. The
dataset has 21 variables and 2,864 rows.
